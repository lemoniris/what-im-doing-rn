going out to see the fireworks ... is it going to rain, is that going to ruin my hair and makeup, do i need an umbrella -- everything is just so complicated

im out to dinner with my parents in philly and i just am so glad it never worked out here for me, i could never move back ever, i got some lamb maroosh to go though, tomorrow im in nyc to do nothing but walk around with my brother, museums and restaurants and ice cream the whole entire dayyy

i think im going to switch to brown lowlights after the summer, that picture is from 2021, yeahhh thats what im going to do

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLc_uu5HpcA this song has been in my head all summer long i want to write about it sometime

it translates to 

My heart, you are a traveler
Life is a journey
Who knows where your destination is

its a good introspective 90s song lolll

im so annoyed that rosalind problem isnt outputting the correct answer, sooo annoyed, ill get it tomorrow i hope, maybe ill write a blog post about the correct solution afterwards

rain today i guess no pool later

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9t607v-TDU my fav song of this summer, good driving music, trying to not think about this mskcc interview thats next week all weekend

busy preparing for another bioinfo interview elsewhere not in ny but its remote and i would get stock options, i kind of like this position more than mskcc, a little bit more i guess, bc the lead for the comp bio team is a prof at dartmouth and it has to do with protein bioinfo, lets see what happensss

i scheduled both interviews at two diff places, mskcc and the biopharm company with stock options, for friday so i only have to dress up once for the zoom interviews, lol, im excited, interviews dont stress me out or anything i just dont like working with shitty/low quality people, i think both of these places are good options, the dartmouth prof is a cs prof it seems ... in bioinformatics, interesting bc they are the comp bio team lead

the other interview was with the biopharma company for a bioinfo posiiton, next interview will be with the dartmouth prof, it looks like an interesting position, ive never been to NH but they said some company meetings will be there in person but the company would pay for hotels and etc. interesting day, i think i like mskcc a little bit more but i dunno maybe its too early to tell rn

watching breaking bad with my brother who has already seen it when it came out, interesting show, it use to be on when we were at rutgers

Untitled.ipynb, Untitled1.ipynb, Untitled2.ipynb and etc. kind of summer

we got an autonomous pool robot thats cleaning the algae in the pool

theres a new turkish bakery that opened in the next town over, maybeeee we'll go there this weekend

i spent the day in north jersey, this lady at neiman marcus sprayed this on me and it smells so good but i like something sweeter https://us.initioparfums.com/products/atomic-rose i wanna smell it again or i might just get it, she said it has turkish rose, i dunno like
it has to be a little sweeter, on the fence, wore black to korean bbq bc i always get it on me its so messy, https://youtu.be/VyGNryifd0E in the long drive back loll https://www.laduree.us/530744/ispahan they had the latte, which was so good, but not the actual macaron 
in the north jersey location, i wonder if they have it in the madison ave location ughhh i love rose anythingg https://youtu.be/KaM1bCuG4xo cant believe august is half way done

iceee cream 🍦

individually wrapped dark chocolate pieces ... soo good 😍 dark chocolate >>> milk chocolate

https://x.com/internethippo/status/1825977875218182615 lolll

u know i was trying to learn more about a controversial science topic via youtube this week (i.e. lectures and podcasts) and i guess the truth is relative?? but im pro that thing and people make really convincing anti that thing arguments, i guess if one is more illinformed and myopic, they would also have an anti view of that thing as well. i guess one can be knowledgeable and right or wrong, illinformed and right or wrong, so is the truth really relative, noo ... its based on evidence, but evidence can be right and wrong, logic can be right and wrong, intentions can be right or wrong and etc. for science ... i think now, people learn first from podcasts then lectures/audiobooks, but they can be annoying if there's a lot of small talk in the middle ... getting introduced to a new topic is through a podcast nowadays, i guess or a blog or reddit

out to dinner with my parents in nyc the weather is so niceee saw a huge cockroach on the sidewalk grosssss; hope this night ends in warm chai 🥹

https://x.com/CristobMorales/status/1825850123194110223 this is such a big deal esp since its just a peptide

i had to do my blood work this morning, i always dread it bc i dont like needles, ive been doing intermittent fasting 16:8 since the summer so i want to see how it improves, trying to get back into rust again this month

my blood work results came back, thyroid and A1c are all good and normal, cholesterol is a bit on the high end ... working on that with the intermittent fasting ... Alhamdulillah what i was dreading turned out to be fine, my A1c needs to be lower tho ... sometimes i make a big deal out of things, i wanna go to an allergy doc and get tested for allergies bc my nose is runny sometimes for no reason

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS2wnyCATRM sometimes i listen to country music lol ...

gym + sushi + salad

chilly morning, watching/listening to a health podcast about intermittent fasting
