going out to see the fireworks ... is it going to rain, is that going to ruin my hair and makeup, do i need an umbrella -- everything is just so complicated

im out to dinner with my parents in philly and i just am so glad it never worked out here for me, i could never move back ever, i got some lamb maroosh to go though, tomorrow im in nyc to do nothing but walk around with my brother, museums and restaurants and ice cream the whole entire dayyy

i think im going to switch to brown lowlights after the summer, that picture is from 2021, yeahhh thats what im going to do

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLc_uu5HpcA this song has been in my head all summer long i want to write about it sometime

it translates to 

My heart, you are a traveler
Life is a journey
Who knows where your destination is

its a good introspective 90s song lolll

im so annoyed that rosalind problem isnt outputting the correct answer, sooo annoyed, ill get it tomorrow i hope, maybe ill write a blog post about the correct solution afterwards

rain today i guess no pool later

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9t607v-TDU my fav song of this summer, good driving music, trying to not think about this mskcc interview thats next week all weekend

busy preparing for another bioinfo interview elsewhere not in ny but its remote and i would get stock options, i kind of like this position more than mskcc, a little bit more i guess, bc the lead for the comp bio team is a prof at dartmouth and it has to do with protein bioinfo, lets see what happensss
